## Why did you make Strategies X?

I started to use AutoStrat, after it got released in 2022. It provides an automatic process so the user won't have to touch the keyboard and mouse. But, the ugly section color of Wally UI V2 makes the main ui look very bad to me. In the first attempt, I use some tricks to make the ui source link change into my own UI. And it was successful, at least I think so. I realized it doesn't work in obfuscated strat. And due to some annoying bugs in that time, I decided to make my own version based on its source in September 2022. I also added many features, fixed bugs, and made it more stable.

Although I considered this as a hobby project, I spent a lot of time making this project work. Also, it took me more than 6 months to release this project due to the loss of motivation and studying to prepare for university. With lots **(IF NOT ALL)** things that have been changed, added, or remade compared to the original one, I decided to rename this project to **"Strategies X"**.
